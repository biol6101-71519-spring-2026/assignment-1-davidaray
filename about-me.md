David Ray, originally from Sumter, SC
My interests are in transposable element biology and genomics more generally.
Personal interests include my family, two kids and a lovely wife. I also like to play chess and watch movies. I'm also a runner.
I enjoy catching animals of all sorts and my research history has allowed me to catch, squamates, crocodilians, and bats.
